# Test Strategy Report

The Test Strategy Report is a high-level document that plans how a project's testing will be conducted.

## **Introduction**

This test strategy defines the approach for verifying and validating the e-commerce website. It ensures that all functional and non-functional aspects are tested effectively, including system integration, security, and performance under real-world conditions. This document aligns testing activities with the Agile software development lifecycle to ensure continuous quality assurance throughout the project.

## Project Overview

The e-commerce platform allows users to:

- Browse products
- Add items to the cart
- Complete purchases via various payment gateways
- Track orders post-purchase

The system integrates with external payment gateways and inventory management systems and must remain performant under high user load, especially during sale events.
