# Test Strategy Report

## **Introduction**

This test strategy defines the approach for verifying and validating the e-commerce website. It ensures that all functional and non-functional aspects are tested effectively, including system integration, security, and performance under real-world conditions. This document aligns testing activities with the Agile software development lifecycle to ensure continuous quality assurance throughout the project.

## Project Overview

The e-commerce platform allows users to:

- Browse products
- Add items to the cart
- Complete purchases via various payment gateways
- Track orders post-purchase

The system integrates with external payment gateways and inventory management systems and must remain performant under high user load, especially during sale events.

## SDLC Alignment

Testing is embedded within the Agile development lifecycle, executed in two-week sprints. Test planning, execution, and regression cycles are integrated with sprint activities to ensure continuous validation. Regression and non-functional testing (e.g., performance and security) occur in parallel with sprint cycles and during hardening phases before production releases.

## Test Objectives & Scope

- Verify functional correctness of all key user flows
- Ensure system stability under peak traffic
- Validate the security of sensitive data, especially during payment
- Confirm cross-platform compatibility
- Validate successful integration with external services

## Test Approach

- Functional testing will be performed using both manual and automated methods to validate user workflows.
- Exploratory and structured testing will verify different scenarios, including edge cases.
- Non-functional testing, such as performance, security, and compatibility, will be handled using specialized tools and executed in dedicated environments.
- Integration testing with third-party systems will include contract, workflow, and failure path validation.

## Testing Types & Techniques

- **Functional Testing**: will validate features such as product browsing, cart management, checkout, order status, and error handling.
- **Integration Testing**: will focus on validating APIs, external services, payment gateways, and inventory sync.
- **Performance Testing**: will measure response time, throughput, and system stability during peak traffic (e.g., sales).
- **Security Testing**: will identify vulnerabilities such as broken authentication and insecure storage, particularly in the checkout and payment areas.
- **Compatibility Testing**: will ensure consistent user experience across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and devices (Android, iOS, tablets).
- **Regression Testing**: Continuous validation of existing features across iterations to avoid breakages.

## Test Environment

Various test environments will be maintained:

- A development sandbox for early testing
- **QA/Staging:** Functional, Integration, and performance testing
- **Test Devices:** Mix of physical and emulated devices for compatibility checks, especially for **manual testing**
- **Simulated Payment Environment:** For safe testing of payment flows
- **Production-like:** Final regression & soak testing prior to release

All environments will be refreshed regularly and pre-loaded with test data and mock services as needed.

## Test Estimation

This outlines the effort, duration, and resources required to complete testing activities within each phase of the development cycle. It is essential for planning sprints, aligning testing with releases, and setting stakeholder expectations.

1. Estimation will be done using a **combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches**, considering:
    - Complexity and number of user stories or features
    - Types of testing required (functional, regression, non-functional, etc.)
    - Reusability of test cases and automation scripts
    - Required test environments and data setup
    - Risk level and impact of defects
    - Dependencies on external systems (e.g., payment gateways)
2. **Estimation Techniques May Include**:
    - **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**: Breaking down tasks into granular units to estimate individual effort.
    - **Three-point estimation**: Using optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely values to account for uncertainty.
    - **Historical data**: Referencing past similar projects for a baseline effort.
    - **Test case point method**: Estimating based on the number and complexity of test cases.
3. **Inclusion of Buffer**
    
    A **buffer (or contingency reserve)** will be added—typically **10–20% of the total estimated effort**—to account for:
    
    - Unforeseen issues or rework
    - Delays in environment readiness or defect resolution
    - Scope changes or late-breaking requirements
    - Resource availability gaps
    
    This buffer helps ensure test completion is not compromised due to unexpected changes or blockers. The exact buffer percentage will be agreed upon during the estimation and reviewed regularly across sprints.
    

Estimates will be reviewed and refined during sprint planning and updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle to accommodate scope changes or unforeseen challenges.

## **Test Data Management**

- Use **realistic but synthetic** data for user profiles, products, and transactions
- Include edge cases (e.g., expired cards, out-of-stock items)

## **Test Deliverables**

The testing team will provide a full suite of documentation, including:

- A detailed test plan
- Test case repository (manual and automated)
- Daily and sprint-level execution reports
- Bug and defect reports
- Test summary and release sign-off reports
- Load test analysis and security audit reports

## **Roles and Responsibilities**

- The QA Lead is responsible for strategy, planning, and coordination.
- Test engineers design and execute test cases.
- Automation engineers build and maintain scripts and CI integrations.
- Security and performance specialists handle non-functional testing.
- Developers collaborate on bug fixes and integration testing.

## Entry and Exit Criteria

- Testing will begin once user stories are defined and environments are available.
- Exit criteria include full test execution, no open critical defects, successful regression and integration tests, and stakeholder sign-off.

## Test Metrics

Key quality indicators include **test coverage**, **defect density**, **pass/fail rates**, **mean time to resolution**, and **performance benchmarks**. 

These will be tracked sprint over sprint to monitor quality trends.

## Test Tools

To support the testing strategy effectively, various tools and frameworks will be utilized across different types of testing. Each tool is selected based on its ability to enhance test coverage, increase efficiency, and integrate with our development and deployment pipelines.

- **Functional Testing**: Selenium, Postman for API testing
- **Test Management**: TestRail or Zephyr for test case documentation and traceability
- **Performance Testing**: JMeter to simulate concurrent users and analyze load behavior
- **Security Testing**: OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite for vulnerability scanning and manual ethical hacking
- **Browser Compatibility Testing**: BrowserStack to validate UI behavior on various browsers and devices
- **CI/CD & Automation**: Jenkins or GitHub Actions integrated with the automation framework (e.g., using Python, JavaScript, or Java)

These tools support both manual and automated workflows, integrated into the CI/CD pipeline for faster feedback loops.

## **Test Data Management**

- Use **realistic but synthetic** data for user profiles, products, and transactions
- Include edge cases (e.g., expired cards, out-of-stock items)

## Defect Management

Defect management includes the complete lifecycle of issues identified during testing. The process covers:

- Logging defects with sufficient detail (steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, environment details, etc.)
- Classifying and prioritizing defects based on severity and impact
- Assigning and tracking issues through investigation and resolution
- Regression testing of fixed issues
- Closure verification
- Reporting defect metrics and trends to stakeholders
- **Jira** will be used as the central defect tracking tool. It will be integrated with test management and development workflows to streamline issue tracking.

A **separate, detailed Defect Management Procedure Document** will be created to define the exact steps, responsibilities, SLAs, and communication protocols. This ensures consistency and traceability across all testing phases.

## Risk Assessment

Risk assessment is performed continuously throughout the project lifecycle. Key risks include:

- **Integration instability with third-party services**: mitigated via mocks and fallback mechanisms
- **Security vulnerabilities in the checkout flow**: mitigated by penetration testing and compliance with OWASP standards
- **Load failures during peak sales**: addressed with early performance testing and cloud-based scaling validation
- **Incomplete test coverage due to evolving requirements**: mitigated via modular, iterative testing and traceability matrices

Each identified risk has an associated mitigation or contingency plan to minimize impact.

## Review and Monitoring

Testing progress will be reviewed through:

- **Daily standups and sprint retrospectives**
- **Burndown charts and dashboards in Jira**
- **Weekly quality status reports** to stakeholders
- **Root cause analysis (RCA)** sessions for major bugs or test failures

Test cases, scripts, and results will be reviewed regularly by peers and leads to ensure quality and relevance. Automation scripts will undergo version control and code reviews. Metrics and defect trends will be monitored to drive continuous improvement in the QA process.
