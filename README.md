# Test Strategy Report

The Test Strategy Report is a high-level document that plans how a project's testing will be conducted.

## **Introduction**

This test strategy defines the approach for verifying and validating the e-commerce website. It ensures that all functional and non-functional aspects are tested effectively, including system integration, security, and performance under real-world conditions. This document aligns testing activities with the Agile software development lifecycle to ensure continuous quality assurance throughout the project.

## Project Overview

The e-commerce platform allows users to:

- Browse products
- Add items to the cart
- Complete purchases via various payment gateways
- Track orders post-purchase

The system integrates with external payment gateways and inventory management systems and must remain performant under high user load, especially during sale events.

## SDLC Alignment

Testing is embedded within the Agile development lifecycle, executed in two-week sprints. Test planning, execution, and regression cycles are integrated with sprint activities to ensure continuous validation. Regression and non-functional testing (e.g., performance and security) occur in parallel with sprint cycles and during hardening phases before production releases.

## Objectives & Scope

- Verify functional correctness of all key user flows
- Ensure system stability under peak traffic
- Validate the security of sensitive data, especially during payment
- Confirm cross-platform compatibility
- Validate successful integration with external services

## Approach

- Functional testing will be performed using both manual and automated methods to validate user workflows.
- Exploratory and structured testing will verify different scenarios, including edge cases.
- Non-functional testing, such as performance, security, and compatibility, will be handled using specialized tools and executed in dedicated environments.
- Integration testing with third-party systems will include contract, workflow, and failure path validation.

## Testing Types

We will rely on unit, integration, security, performance, accessibility, regression, and compatibility testing.

## Environment

Various test environments will be maintained:

- A development sandbox for early testing
- **QA/Staging:** Functional, Integration, and performance testing
- **Test Devices:** Mix of physical and emulated devices for compatibility checks, especially for **manual testing**
- **Simulated Payment Environment:** For safe testing of payment flows
- **Production-like:** Final regression & soak testing prior to release

All environments will be refreshed regularly and pre-loaded with test data and mock services as needed.

## Estimation

This outlines the effort, duration, and resources required to complete testing activities within each phase of the development cycle. It is essential for planning sprints, aligning testing with releases, and setting stakeholder expectations.

Internally, we will adopt **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** and **Test case point method** interchangeably.

## Data Management

- Use **realistic but synthetic** data for user profiles, products, and transactions
- Include edge cases (e.g., expired cards, out-of-stock items)
