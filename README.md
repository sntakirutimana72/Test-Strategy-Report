# Test Strategy Report

The Test Strategy Report is a high-level document that plans how a project's testing will be conducted.

## **Introduction**

This test strategy defines the approach for verifying and validating the e-commerce website. It ensures that all functional and non-functional aspects are tested effectively, including system integration, security, and performance under real-world conditions. This document aligns testing activities with the Agile software development lifecycle to ensure continuous quality assurance throughout the project.

## Project Overview

The e-commerce platform allows users to:

- Browse products
- Add items to the cart
- Complete purchases via various payment gateways
- Track orders post-purchase

The system integrates with external payment gateways and inventory management systems and must remain performant under high user load, especially during sales events.

## SDLC Alignment

Testing is embedded within the Agile development lifecycle, executed in two-week sprints. Test planning, execution, and regression cycles are integrated with sprint activities to ensure continuous validation. Regression and non-functional testing (e.g., performance and security) occur in parallel with sprint cycles and during hardening phases before production releases.

## Objectives & Scope

- Verify functional correctness of all key user flows
- Ensure system stability under peak traffic
- Validate the security of sensitive data, especially during payment
- Confirm cross-platform compatibility
- Validate successful integration with external services

## Approach

- Functional testing will be performed using both manual and automated methods to validate user workflows.
- Exploratory and structured testing will verify different scenarios, including edge cases.
- Non-functional testing, such as performance, security, and compatibility, will be handled using specialized tools and executed in dedicated environments.
- Integration testing with third-party systems will include contract, workflow, and failure path validation.

## Testing Types

We will rely on unit, integration, security, performance, accessibility, regression, and compatibility testing.

## Environment

Various test environments will be maintained:

- A development sandbox for early testing
- **QA/Staging:** Functional, Integration, and performance testing
- **Test Devices:** Mix of physical and emulated devices for compatibility checks, especially for **manual testing**
- **Simulated Payment Environment:** For safe testing of payment flows
- **Production-like:** Final regression & soak testing prior to release

All environments will be refreshed regularly and pre-loaded with test data and mock services as needed.

## Estimation

This outlines the effort, duration, and resources required to complete testing activities within each phase of the development cycle. It is essential for planning sprints, aligning testing with releases, and setting stakeholder expectations.

Internally, we will adopt **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** and **Test case point method** interchangeably.

## Data Management

- Use **realistic but synthetic** data for user profiles, products, and transactions
- Include edge cases (e.g., expired cards, out-of-stock items)

## **Deliverables**

The testing team will provide a full suite of documentation, including:

- A detailed test plan
- Test case repository (manual and automated)
- Daily and sprint-level execution reports
- Bug and defect reports
- Test summary and release sign-off reports
- Load test analysis and security audit reports

## Roles & Responsibilities

We will work with the QA Manager, developers, DevOps, and Testers

## Entry and Exit Criteria

- Testing will begin once user stories are defined and environments are available.
- Exit criteria include full test execution, no open critical defects, successful regression and integration tests, and stakeholder sign-off.

## Test Metrics

Key quality indicators include **test coverage**, **defect density**, **pass/fail rates**, **mean time to resolution**, and **performance benchmarks**. 
These will be tracked sprint over sprint to monitor quality trends.

## Tools

We will integrate various tools and frameworks with different types of testing. 
Each tool is selected based on its ability to enhance test coverage, increase efficiency, and integrate with our development and deployment pipelines.
Mainly, we will use Selenium, JIRA, Postman, Jenkins, GitHub actions, JMeter, TestRail, CI/CD, and OWASP ZAP.

## Defect Management

This will have a separate lifecycle, and a separate governing document should be produced.

## Timeline

As part of Agile development custom, all testing activities and efforts will be conducted in sprints. Required effort and time will be calculated based on available resources & other factoring conditions.

## Risk Assessment

Risk assessment is performed continuously throughout the project lifecycle. Key risks include:

- **Integration instability with third-party services**: mitigated via mocks and fallback mechanisms
- **Security vulnerabilities in the checkout flow**: mitigated by penetration testing and compliance with OWASP standards
- **Load failures during peak sales**: addressed with early performance testing and cloud-based scaling validation
- **Incomplete test coverage due to evolving requirements**: mitigated via modular, iterative testing and traceability matrices

Each identified risk has an associated mitigation or contingency plan to minimize impact.

## Review and Monitoring

Testing progress will be reviewed through:

- **Daily standups and sprint retrospectives**
- **Burndown charts and dashboards in Jira**
- **Weekly quality status reports** to stakeholders
- **Root cause analysis (RCA)** sessions for major bugs or test failures

Test cases, scripts, and results will be reviewed regularly by peers and leads to ensure quality and relevance. Automation scripts will undergo version control and code reviews. Metrics and defect trends will be monitored to drive continuous improvement in the QA process.
